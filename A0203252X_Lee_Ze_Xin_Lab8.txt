while(true) {
	1) scan for n, if n == -1 break
	2) create an adjacency matrix of nxn
	3) take in values and fill the adjacency matrix
	4) use a for loop with 2 nested for loops 
	5) if (adjMatrix[i][j] == 1) { then we found an edge, now search for edges that can form triangle
                        for (int k = j; k < n; k++) {
                            if (adjMatrix[i][k] == 1 && adjMatrix[j][k] == 1) {
                                triangle = true;
                                break;
                            }
                        }
                    }
	6) if we found triangle, then break out of the inner 2 for loops
	7) At end of checking for each vertex, if we haven't break out means we have not found a triangle. Thus a strong vertex(no need to print). Else print it.
