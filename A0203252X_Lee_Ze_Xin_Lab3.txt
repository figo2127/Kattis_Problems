Set up StringBuffer, PrintWriter, and BufferedReader. 

class FirstTwo implements Comparable<FirstTwo>:
//FirstTwo is an object which contains the first 2 characters //of a String.
	public int compareTo(FirstTwo value):
		- compare first characters and return the corresponding integer value.
		- If 0 is the returned value, then we compare the second characters.

main():
Take in the first integer input as N.
Store 
if N>0, then we use the Loop below.

	Loop: 
		- Populate an ArrayList of String with our names from the BufferedReader.
		- Collections.sort(arrlist)
		- then print out using printwriter and Stringbuffer.
