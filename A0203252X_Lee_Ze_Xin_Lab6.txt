1) Read numResearchers as n, minsInactiveToLock as m.
2) Read and store arrivalTime and stayTime in an ArrayList of Researchers, R.
3) Initialize a PQ<WorkStation> W.
4) Read in lines and store them into our R arraylist, sort them in terms of earliest start time. //since we got the schedule
5) For each of the researcher in R, check if W is empty, if yes we create a new workstation and add to W.
	Else we poll from W:
		if currentResearcher.start == W.poll().endTime:
			count++;
			W.offer(new WorkStation with updated time)
		else if (currResearcher.start <= W.poll().extendedEnd && currResearcher.start > W.poll().endTime):
			count++;
		
	W.offer(newStation);
