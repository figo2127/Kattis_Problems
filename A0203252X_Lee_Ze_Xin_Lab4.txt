Pseudocode:
enum Status {
  FOLDED,
  FIRST,
  PALM
}
1) Represent players as list of pairs (Player, State). State can either be "folded", "fist", or "palm"
2) Rhyme selects the player (i + state - 1) % num of players after player i.
3) if (p, folded) is hit, remove it and insert 2 (p, fist) at current position.
4) if (p, fist) is hit, replace with (p, palm).
5) if (p, palm) is hit remove.
6) repeat until only one hand left.
